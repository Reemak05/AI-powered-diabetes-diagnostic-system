Type 2 diabetes is more common and develops over time, often due to lifestyle factors like poor diet and lack of exercise; the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn’t produce enough. Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy and usually disappears after delivery, but it increases the mother\'s risk of developing Type 2 diabetes later. Understanding the types and their symptoms is crucial in managing the condition and reducing long-term health risks.', 'bdcf39b5500d4db998bebdf67fa2df35.jpeg', 'Hello My Name is Reem', 'Our platform is designed to assist individuals in monitoring their health and detecting early signs of diabetes through advanced machine learning techniques. We combine technology and healthcare to provide users with an intelligent, easy-to-use system that offers real-time feedback, personalized insights, and secure health data management. This system is the result of a senior project developed by dedicated Computer Science students aiming to make a meaningful impact in the health tech field. Our goal is to empower users with tools that promote awareness, prevention, and timely intervention in diabetes management. Your health, our mission.', 'Aboutus.png');
