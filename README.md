# AI-Powered Diabetes Diagnostic System 
## Overview
This project is an AI-based web application designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients by analyzing health data such as BMI, blood pressure, glucose levels, and other relevant factors. The system uses machine learning models integrated into a user-friendly chatbot interface to collect data, determine the type of diabetes (or if the user is diabetic or not), and provide personalized recommendations based on the results.  

All user inputs, along with their diagnosis and recommendations, are saved with timestamps and displayed on a health logs page featuring graphs for key features like BMI and blood pressure over time.  

The admin dashboard allows administrators to view individual user results, manage users, monitor website statistics (such as the total number of users and diabetes prevalence), and update the website content shown to users.
